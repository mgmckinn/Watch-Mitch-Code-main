        <h2><em>My Story:</em></h2>
        <p>I have always had a passion for technology but for some reason I never breached the subject purely out of fear to get into something new. Growing up my parents always had new computers, and software. In the 90s that was a bigger deal than it is now. I went to school for business management and did not give it a second thought. Now 10 years into my career I find I 'm having the best time at work with I 'm troubleshooting tech issues for my co-workers or executives throughout the company. This prompted me to look into computer science. Now that the initial fear is gone and I am building confidence each keystroke, I am happy to say I have found my happy place. I truly believe I can do the best by myself and my family by excelling in this industry.</p>
